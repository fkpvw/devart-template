# Growth

## Description
Growth explores the natural mechanism of growth as a new visual language for creating forms. The basis for the algorithm can be stated simply as such - nodes grow marginally towards the nearest sources of nutrients. A more elaborate explanation can be found below.

I will be using this simple rule to visualise data and 'grow' 3D printed objects, to demonstrate the mechanism as a rich production process. An interactive Android app will also be created for users to explore the mechanism by adding their own sources, as an educational component.

The motivation to explore this mechanism is twofold. The resulting forms will bear an obvious resemblance to nature, making it a powerful tool for juxtaposition or reinforcement in depicting our relationship with our environment. It also allows us to infuse communicative elements by designating the placement of sources, unlike more deterministic modeling like [L-system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system "L-system") or more randomised algorithms like [Diffusion-limited aggregation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion-limited_aggregation "Diffusion-limited aggregation").

The project will become increasingly defined through time. The actual forms to be created will be closely associated with issues we debate on and with objects we use on an everyday basis. These things will directly relate to the nature of the explored mechanism.

## Link to Prototype
For viewers interested in running the sketches in Processing as they come by, please feel free to explore the project_code folder for this entry in Github.

## Links to External Libraries
This section will be updated as the project expands. Right now, only Processing is used for the initial sketch. As I can foresee, external libraries will be used for optimisation, glyph processing, data mining/parsing and extensions to 3D in later stages.

## References
The primary inspiration for this project comes from a paper I read a few years back when I was first introduced to generative art - [Modeling and visualization of leaf venation patterns](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/venation.sig2005.pdf "Modeling and visualization of leaf venation patterns") which describes the growing process of leaf veins. Growth can be seen as an abstraction of the growth mechanism described by the paper, applied liberally to artificially conceived forms. The mechanism is briefly summarised below -

1. Initial nodes are placed
2. Sources of nutrients are placed away and randomly from the nodes
3. The directions of growth for each node is influenced by the nearest sources
4. Sources are removed as they are depleted

The philosophical basis of the project is inspired by a book published in 1945 - [On Growth and Form](https://archive.org/details/ongrowthform00thom "On Growth and Form") - written by Thompson, D'Arcy Wentworth.

I aim to have a major update and 2 minor updates per week.
