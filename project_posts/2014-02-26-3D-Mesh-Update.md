# 3D Mesh Update

Chose to start with the physical object/3D printing component since there is lead production time. I aim to print at least 1 prototype for the competition. Falling a little behind due to work commitments (starting a design studio is not easy), but no excuses!

Used Karsten Schmidt's (hello judge!) toxiclibs - volumeutils to add a spherical brush stroke at each node. Corrected a mistake which slowed things down. The simulation is slow but does not have memory issues. Will use a 3D model next, using planar intersection points as sources (hemesh library) for more control. Let's see how this plays out.

Once again, if you have Processing installed, please feel free to try this sketch out here and let me know any ideas you have -
