# First Sketch

My first post will be to program a basic sketch, as a basis to explore more. Here, there is only one initial node at the centre of the screen, and sources are added randomly at every frame, at the edge of a expanding circle. This is perhaps how the veins of a leaf will look like if it is a perfect circle!

The sources are indicated in red, and can be seen to influence the growth of the nodes. They are removed if they are too near to the nodes (i.e. smaller than a certain kill distance). Next steps will be exploring how different parameters, different starting nodes and different ways of adding the sources etc... can give us a bit more control.
