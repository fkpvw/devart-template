# Minor Update - Adding Interaction

Just adding an additional sketch, a minor update where the user can add sources by clicking or dragging across the screen. This will serve as a base for me to create the Android app for the exhibition. I would imagine that a few tablets will be installed, and the viewer will be able to explore this mechanism, and create something as a souvenir. 

Right now it looks really rudimentary, and while I think it does the job of 'getting the hang of it', much more work will be done to enhance it visually.

If you have Processing installed, please feel free to try this sketch out here and let me know any ideas you have -

I will probably have another minor update in the next day or two, and that will be a basic extension to 3D for creating objects to be 3D Printed. Stay tuned!

Below are just some videos of me experimenting with the sketch (with a mouse!), providing very very first visuals of what is possible.
