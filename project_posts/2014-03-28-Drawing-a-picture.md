# Drawing a Picture with the Growth Mechanism

This will be my second last update, demonstrating the use of the growth mechanism to draw a picture, juxtaposing the language with the selection of images to convey ideas. Here, nodes are placed randomly throughout the application frame while sources are placed only on the bright areas of the image. 

The familiar Mona Lisa portrait is used as a starting point to validate the idea, that it will indeed be recognisable. I will extend this with RGB values for my next and last update, in which I will wrap up my thoughts.
