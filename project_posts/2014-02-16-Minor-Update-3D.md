# Minor Update - 3D

Adding the Z coordinate for the main sketch which I will be building upon. This will be to grow and create 3D models for 3D printing purposes. Here, the sources are placed randomly within the boundaries of a cylinder, layer by layer. It will be extended such that external 3D (surface) model can be imported and 'grown'. 

Speed optimisation will definitely be one important thing to tackle at this point, and it should be specific for each of the 3 targets I am aiming for.

About 6 weeks left in the competition, 2 weeks each for 3 components - User Interaction, 3D Printed Object and Data Visualisation. Will require further conceptual development, exploration and execution for each.

Once again, if you have Processing installed, please feel free to try this sketch out here and let me know any ideas you have -
